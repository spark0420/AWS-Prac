## Generate AWS Credentials and Installed AWS CLI
- Using syntax below, you can make your environment to install CLI automatically whenever you start your Gitpod

Update our `.gitpod.yml` to include the following task.

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```
- You can also set PATH so that your working environment can remember your AWS account 

Find these three info below and export them using the syntax below.
It will make Gitpod to remember these credentials if we relaunch our workspaces

```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Check if your environment with the credentials is set using the syntax below

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
